  - "Password security starts with a long password. \r\nAnything over 14 characters
    can be difficult to hack!"
  - 'A simple way of adding complexity to your password

    is by CAPITALISING
    some of the letters and using numbers.'
  - 'You could use different special characters to create unique

    password.
    Re-using the same password is never a good idea!
